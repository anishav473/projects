E-commerce Store Project Summary

This project is a mini E-commerce store developed using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship assignment.

The application displays multiple products with images,
descriptions, prices, and quantity controls. Product cards
are designed with a modern and professional user interface.
Image sizes are optimized to maintain a clean and balanced
layout similar to real e-commerce websites.

cart functionality.

This project demonstrates:
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
