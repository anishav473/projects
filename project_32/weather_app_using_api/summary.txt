Weather App Project Summary

This Weather App is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main objective of this project is to practice JavaScript
DOM manipulation, form handling, event listeners, and basic
asynchronous behavior.

The application allows users to enter a city name and view
weather details such as temperature, weather condition, and
humidity. A loading message is displayed to simulate real-time
data fetching and improve user experience.

Mock weather data is used in this project to demonstrate the
working of a weather application without using an external API.
This approach helps in understanding JavaScript logic clearly
without dependency on API keys.

The project focuses on:
- Clean and attractive user interface
- Responsive design
- Proper JavaScript logic
- User-friendly interaction

This project helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript
and frontend development concepts.
