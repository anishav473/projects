Project Name: Parallax Hover Effect Card

Description:
  - A stylish card with a background image and text on top.
  - When the user hovers, the background image zooms in and moves slightly for a parallax effect.

      * <div class="parallax-card"> → main card container.
      * <div class="parallax-bg"> → background image layer.
      * <div class="parallax-content"> → text displayed on top.
  - CSS:
      * Body is centered with flexbox and dark background.
      * The card has rounded corners, hidden overflow, and perspective for 3D feel.
      * Background uses Unsplash image, scales up, and shifts up on hover.
      * Text has white color and shadow for visibility.

Features:
  - Smooth hover animation with `transition`.
  - Eye-catching zoom + movement effect.
  - Reusable for banners, agency cards, or portfolio highlights.
