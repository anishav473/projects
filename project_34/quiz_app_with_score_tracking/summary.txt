Quiz App with Score Tracking – Project Summary

This project is a Quiz Application developed using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript as part of my internship tasks.

The application presents multiple-choice questions to the
user one by one. Users can select an answer and move to the
next question. At the end of the quiz, the final score is
displayed on the screen.

JavaScript is used extensively for DOM manipulation, event
handling, question navigation, and score calculation. The
best score achieved by the user is stored in the browser
using Local Storage, allowing score tracking across sessions.
