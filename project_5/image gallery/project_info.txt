Project Name: Simple Image Gallery

Description:
  - This project is a simple image gallery created using HTML and CSS.
  - It displays multiple images in one place, arranged in a clean layout.
  - Each image is clickable and opens the full-size version when clicked.
  - The gallery design is simple, neat, and easy to understand.

Implementation:
  - HTML is used to build the structure of the page:
        * <h1> tag for the main title.
        * <div class="gallery"> to hold all images.
        * <a> tags used so each image is clickable.
        * <img> tags used to display the images.
  - CSS is used to style the page:
        * Body has pink background with some margin and padding.
        * Gallery uses "inline-flex" to arrange images in a row.
        * Added gap between images for better spacing.
        * Borders and rounded corners are added to images for a clean look.

Features:
  - Responsive design: images automatically adjust their size.
  - Attractive layout with equal spacing between pictures.
  - Borders make the gallery look neat and professional.
  - Easy to expand: more images can be added just by adding <a><img></a>.
